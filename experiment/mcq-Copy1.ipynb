really the eleventh significant release of the platform. Whilst staying true to the\\noriginal ideas of the platform, there have been numerous developments adding a\\nvariety of features to the language syntax as well as a huge number of APIs to the\\ncore class libraries. This has enabled developers to become substantially more pro-\\nductive and has helped to eliminate a variety of common situations that can easily\\nresult in bugs.\\nJava has continued to grow in popularity, which is in large part attributable to the\\ncontinued evolution of the platform, which keeps it fresh and addresses things that\\ndevelopers want. According to some source s, there are more than nine million Java\\nprogrammers across the globe and this number looks set to continue to grow as\\nmost universities use Java as a primary teaching language. \\nWith so many Java programmers available to employers, how do they ensure that\\ncandidates have the necessary skills to develop high-quality, reliable code? The\\nanswer is certification: a standardized test of a developer’s knowledge about the\\nwide variety of features and techniques re quired to use Java efficiently and effec-\\ntively. Originally introduced by Sun Microsystems, the certification process and\\nexam has been updated to match the features of each release of Java. Oracle has\\ncontinued this since acquiring Sun in 2010.\\nTaking and passing the exams is not a simple task. To ensure that developers meet\\na high standard of knowledge about Java, the candidate must demonstrate the\\nability to understand a wide variety of programming techniques, a clear grasp of\\nthe Java syntax, and a comprehensive knowledge of the standard class library\\nAPIs. With the release of JDK 8, not only do Java developers need to understand\\nthe details of imperative and object-oriented programming, they now need to have\\na grasp of functional programming so they can effectively use the key new fea-\\ntures: lambda expressions and the Streams API.\\nWhich is why, ultimately, you need this book to help you prepare for the exam. The\\nauthors have done a great job of presenting the material you need to know to passxxviii FOREWORD\\nthe exam in an approachable and easy-to-grasp way. The book starts with the fun-\\ndamental concepts and language syntax and works its way through what you need\\nto know about object-oriented programming before addressing more complex topics\\nlike generic types. The latter part of the book addresses the most recent changes in\\nJDK 8, that of lambda expressions, the Streams API, and the new Date and Time API.\\nHaving worked with Java almost since it was first released, both at Sun Microsystems\\nand then at Oracle Corporation, I think you will find this book an invaluable guide\\nto help you pass the Oracle Certified Associate Exam for Java SE 8. I wish you the\\nbest of luck!\\n—Simon Ritter\\nDeputy CTO, Azul SystemsxxixPreface\\nWriting This Book\\nDear Reader, what you hold in your hand is the result of a meticulous high-tech\\noperation that took many months and required inspecting many parts, removing\\ncertain parts, retrofitting some old parts, and adding many new parts to our previ-\\nous book on an earlier Java programmer certification exam, until we were com-\\npletely satisfied with the result. After you have read the book and passed the exam,\\nwe hope that you will appreciate the TLC (tender loving care) that has gone into\\nthis operation. This is how it all came about.\\nLearning the names of Java certifications and the required exams is the first item\\non the agenda. This book provides coverage for the exam to earn Oracle Certified\\nAssociate (OCA), Java SE 8 Programmer Certification  (also know as OCAJP8). The\\nexam required for this certification has the name Java SE 8 Programmer I Exam\\n(Exam number 1Z0-808 ). It is the first of two exams required to obtain Oracle Certi-\\nfied Professional (OCP), Java  SE 8 Programmer Certification  (also known as OCPJP8).\\nThe second exam required for this professional certification has the name Java SE 8\\nProgrammer II Exam  (Exam number 1Z0-809 ). To reiterate, this book covers only\\nthe topics for the Java SE 8 Programmer I Exam  that is required to obtain OCAJP8\\ncertification.\\nA book on the new Java SE 8 certification was a long time coming. The mantle of\\nJava had been passed on to Oracle and Java 7 had hit the newsstand. We started\\nout to write a book to cover the topics for the two exams required to earn the Oracle\\nCertified Professional, Java SE 7 Programmer Certification . Soon after the release of\\nJava 8, Oracle announced the certification for Java SE 8. We decided to switch to\\nthe new version. It was not a difficult de cision to make. Java 8 marks a watershed\\nwhen the language went from being a pure object-oriented language to one that also\\nincorporates features of functional-style programming. As the saying goes, Java 8\\nchanged the whole ballgame. Java passed it s twentieth birthday in 2015. Java 8,\\nreleased a year earlier, represented a sign ificant milestone in its history. There was\\nlittle reason to dwell on earlier versions.xxx PREFACE\\nThe next decision concerned whether it would be best to provide coverage for the two\\nJava SE 8 Programmer Certification exams in  one or two books. Pragmatic reasons dic-\\ntated two books. It would take far too long to complete a book that covered both\\nexams, mainly because the second exam was largely revamped and would require a\\nlot of new material. We decided to complete the book for the first exam. Once that deci-\\nsion was made, our draft manuscript went back on the operating table.\\nOur approach to writing this book has not changed from the one we employed for\\nour previous books, mainly because it has proved successful. No stones were left\\nunturned to create this book, as we explain here.\\nThe most noticeable changes in the exam for OCAJP8 are the inclusion of the core\\nclasses in the new Date and Time API and the writing of predicates using lambda\\nexpressions. The emphasis remains on analyzing code scenarios, rather than indi-\\nvidual language constructs. The exam cont inues to require actual experience with\\nthe language, not just mere recitation of facts. We still claim that proficiency in the\\nlanguage is the key to success.\\nSince the exam emphasizes the core features of Java, this book provides in-depth\\ncoverage of topics related to those featur es. As in our earlier books, supplementary\\ntopics are also included to aid in mastering the exam topics.\\nThis book is no different from our previous books in one other important aspect: It\\nis a one-stop guide, providing a mixture of theory and practice that enables readers\\nto prepare for the exam. It can be used to learn Java and to prepare for the exam.\\nAfter the exam is passed, it can also come in handy as a language guide.\\nApart from including coverage of the new topics, our discussions of numerous\\ntopics from the previous exam were extensively revised. All elements found in our\\nprevious books (e.g., sections, examples, figures, tables, review questions, mock\\nexam questions) were closely scrutinize d. New examples, figures, tables, and\\nreview questions were specifically created for the new topics as well as for the\\nrevised ones. We continue to use UML (Unified Modeling Language) extensively\\nto illustrate concepts and language constructs, and all numbered examples con-\\ntinue to be complete Java programs ready for experimenting. \\nFeedback from readers regarding our previous books was invaluable in shaping\\nthis book. Every question, suggestion, and comment received was deliberated\\nupon. We are grateful for every single email we have received over the years; that\\ninput proved invaluable in improving this book. \\nDear Reader, we wish you all the best should you decide to go down the path of\\nJava certification. May your loops terminate and your exceptions get caught!\\nAbout This Book\\nThis book provides extensive coverage of the core features of the Java program-\\nming language and its core application programming interface (API), with particularPREFACE xxxi\\nemphasis on its syntax and usage. The book is primarily intended for professionals\\nwho want to prepare for the Java SE 8 Programmer I  exam, but it is readily accessible\\nto any programmer who wants to master the language. For both purposes, it pro-\\nvides in-depth coverage of essential features of the language and its core API.\\nThe demand for well-trained and highly skilled Java programmers remains\\nunabated. Oracle offers many Java certifications that professionals can take to val-\\nidate their skills (see http://education.oracle.com ). The certification provides mem-\\nbers of the IT industry with a standard to use when hiring such professionals, and\\nit allows professionals to turn their Java skills into credentials that are important\\nfor career advancement.\\nThe book provides extensive coverage of all the objectives defined by Oracle for\\nthe Java SE 8 Programmer I  exam. The exam objectives are selective, however, and\\ndo not include many of the essential features of Java. This book covers many addi-\\ntional topics that every Java programmer should master to be truly proficient. In\\nthis regard, the book is a comprehensive primer for learning the Java programming\\nlanguage. After mastering the language by working through this book, the reader\\ncan confidently sit for the exam.\\nThis book is not a complete reference for Java, as it does not attempt to list every mem-\\nber of every class from the Java SE platform API documentation. The purpose is not to\\ndocument the Java SE platform API. The emphasis is more on the Java programming\\nlanguage features—their syntax and correct usage through code examples—and less\\non teaching programming techniques. \\nThe book assumes little background in programming. We believe the exam is\\naccessible to any programmer who works through the book. A Java programmer\\ncan easily skip over material that is well understood and concentrate on parts that\\nneed reinforcing, whereas a programmer new to Java will find the concepts\\nexplained from basic principles. \\nEach topic is explained and discussed t horoughly with examples, and backed by\\nreview questions and exercises to reinforce the concepts. The book is not biased toward\\nany particular platform, but provides pl atform-specific details where necessary.\\nUsing This Book\\nThe reader can choose a linear or a nonlinear route through the book, depending\\non his or her programming background. Non-Java programmers wishing to\\nmigrate to Java can read Chapter 1, which provides a short introduction to object-\\noriented programming concepts, and the procedure for compiling and running\\nJava applications. For those preparing for Java SE 8 Programmer I  exam, the book\\nhas a separate appendix (Appendix A) pr oviding all the pertinent information on\\npreparing for and taking the exam.\\nCross-references are provided where necessa ry to indicate the relationships among\\nthe various constructs of the language. To understand a language construct, allxxxii PREFACE\\npertinent details are provided where the construct is covered, but in addition,\\ncross-references are provided to indicate its relationship to other constructs. Some-\\ntimes it is necessary to postpone discussion of certain aspects of a topic if they\\ndepend on concepts that have not yet been covered in the book. A typical example\\nis the consequences of object-oriented programming concepts (for example, inher-\\nitance) on the member declarations that can occur in a class. This approach can\\nresult in forward references in the initial chapters of the book.\\nThe table of contents; listings of tables , examples, and figures; and a comprehen-\\nsive index facilitate locating topics discussed in the book.\\nIn particular, we draw attention to the following features of the book:\\nReview Questions\\nReview questions are provided after every major topic to test and reinforce the\\nmaterial. The review questions predominantly reflect the kind of multiple-choice\\nquestions that can be asked on the actual exam. On the exam, the exact number of\\nanswers to choose for each question is explicitly stated. The review questions in\\nthis book follow that practice. \\nMany questions on the actual exam contain code snippets with line numbers to\\nindicate that complete implementation is not provided, and that the necessary\\nmissing code to compile and run the code snippets can be assumed. The review\\nquestions in this book provide complete  code implementations where possible, so\\nthat the code can be readily compiled and run.\\nAnnotated answers to the review questions are provided in Appendix C.Programmer I Exam Objectives\\n0.1 Exam objectives are stated clearly at the beginning of every chapter.\\n0.2 The number in front of the objective identifies the exam objective, as \\ndefined by Oracle, and can be found in Appendix B.\\n0.3 The objectives are organized into major sections, detailing the curriculum \\nfor the exam.\\n0.4 The objectives for the Java SE 8 Programmer I  exam are reproduced verbatim \\nin Appendix B, where for each section of the syllabus, references are \\nincluded to point the reader to  relevant topics in the book.\\nSupplementary Objectives\\n• Supplementary objectives cover topics that are not on the exam, but which \\nwe believe are important for mastering the topics that are on the exam.\\n• Any supplementary objective is listed as a bullet at the beginning of the \\nchapter.PREFACE xxxiii\\nExample 0.1 Example Source Code\\nWe encourage readers to experiment with the code examples to reinforce the mate-\\nrial from the book. These examples can be downloaded from the book website \\n(see p. xxxiv).\\nJava code is presented in a monospaced font . Lines of code in the examples or in code\\nsnippets are referenced in the text by a number, which is specified by using a\\nsingle-line comment in the code. For exampl e, in the following code snippet, the\\ncall to the method doSomethingInteresting()  at (1) does something interesting:\\n// ...\\ndoSomethingInteresting();                                                 // (1)\\n// ...\\nNames of classes and interfaces start with an uppercase letter. Names of packages,\\nvariables, and methods start with a lowercase letter. Constants are in all uppercase\\nletters. Interface names begin with the prefix I, when it makes sense to distinguish\\nthem from class names. Coding conventions are followed, except when we have\\nhad to deviate from these conventions in the interest of space or clarity.\\nChapter Summary\\nEach chapter concludes with a summary of the topics covered in the chapter, point-\\ning out the major concepts that were introduced.\\nProgramming Exercises\\nProgramming exercises at the end of each chapter provide the opportunity to put\\nconcepts into practice. Solutions to the programming exercises are provided in\\nAppendix D.\\nMock Exam\\nThe mock exam in Appendix E should be attempted when the reader feels confi-\\ndent about the topics on the exam. It is highly recommended to read Appendix A\\nbefore attempting the mock exam, as A ppendix A contains pertinent information\\nabout the questions to expect on the actual exam. Each multiple-choice question in\\nthe mock exam explicitly states how many answers are applicable for a given ques-\\ntion, as is the case on the actual exam. Annotated answers to the questions in the\\nmock exam are provided in Appendix F.\\nJava SE Platform API Documentation\\nA vertical gray bar is used to highlight methods and fields found in the classes\\nof the Java SE Platform API.\\nAny explanation following the API information is also similarly highlighted.xxxiv PREFACE\\nTo obtain the maximum benefit from using this book in preparing for the Java SE 8\\nProgrammer I  exam, we strongly recommend installing the latest version (Release 8\\nor newer) of the JDK and its accompanying API documentation.

For the purpose of this book,\\nwe will use the following simplified syntax of a class declaration:\\nclass_modifiers class  class_name \\n                               extends_clause \\n                               implements_clause  // Class header\\n{ // Class body\\n    field_declarations\\n   method_declarations\\n   constructor_declarations\\n}\\nIn the class header, the name of the class is preceded by the keyword class . In\\naddition, the class header can specify the following information: \\n•A n  accessibility modifier  (§4.5, p. 118)\\n• Additional class modifiers  (§4.6, p. 120)\\n•A n y  c l a s s  i t  extends  (§7.1, p. 264)\\n• Any interfaces it implements  (§7.6, p. 290)\\nThe class body, enclosed in braces ( {}), can contain member  declarations . In this\\nbook, we discuss the following two kinds of member declarations:\\n•Field declarations  (§2.3, p. 40)\\n•Method declarations  (§3.2, p. 49)\\nMembers declared static  belong to the class and are called static members . Non-\\nstatic members belong to the objects of the class and are called instance members . In\\naddition, the following declarations can be included in a class body:\\n•Constructor declarations  (§3.3, p. 53)\\nThe declarations can appear in any order in the class body. The only mandatory\\nparts of the class declaration syntax are the keyword class , the class name, and the\\nclass body braces ( {}), as exemplified by the following class declaration:\\nclass X { }\\nTo understand which code can be legally declared in a class, we distinguish\\nbetween static context  and non-static context . A static context is defined by static\\nmethods, static field initializers, and static initializer blocks. A non-static context\\nis defined by instance methods, non-stat ic field initializers, instance initializer\\nblocks, and constructors. By static code , we mean expressions and statements in a\\nstatic context; by non-static code , we mean expressions and statements in a non-\\nstatic context. One crucial difference between the two contexts is that static code\\ncan refer only to other static members.3.2: METHOD DECLARATIONS 49\\n3.2 Method Declarations\\nFor the purpose of this book, we will use the following simplified syntax of a\\nmethod declaration:\\nmethod_modifiers  return_type  method_name  \\n               ( formal_parameter_list ) throws_clause  // Method header\\n{ // Method body\\nlocal_variable_declarations\\nstatements\\n}\\nIn addition to the name of the method, the method header can specify the follow-\\ning information:\\n•S c o p e  o r  accessibility modifier  (§4.7, p. 123)\\n• Additional method modifiers  (§4.8, p. 131)\\n•T h e  type of the return value , or void if the method does not return any value\\n(§6.4, p. 224)\\n•A  formal parameter list\\n•A n y  exceptions  thrown by the method, which are specified in a throws  clause\\n(§6.9, p. 251)\\nThe formal parameter list  is a comma-separated list of parameters for passing infor-\\nmation to the method when the method is invoked by a method call  (§3.5, p. 72). An\\nempty parameter list must be specified by ( ). Each parameter is a simple variable\\ndeclaration consisting of its type and name:\\noptional_parameter_modifier  type parameter_name\\nThe parameter names are local to the method (§4.4, p. 117). The optional parameter\\nmodifier  final  is discussed in §3.5, p. 80. It is recommended to use the @param  tag in\\na Javadoc comment to document the formal parameters of a method.\\nThe signature  of a method comprises the name of the method and the types of the\\nformal parameters only.\\nThe method body is a block  containing the local variable declarations  (§2.3, p. 40) and\\nthe statements  of the method.\\nThe mandatory parts of a method declaration are the return type, the method\\nname, and the method body braces ( {}), as exemplified by the following method\\ndeclaration:\\nvoid noAction() {}\\nLike member variables, member methods can be characterized as one of two types:\\n•Instance  methods , which are discussed later in this section\\n•Static methods , which are discussed in §4.8, p. 13250 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\nStatements\\nStatements in Java can be grouped into various categories. Variable declarations\\nwith explicit initialization of the variables are called declaration statements  (§2.3, p. 40,\\nand §3.4, p. 60). Other basic forms of statements are control flow statements  (§6.1, p. 200)\\nand expression statements .\\nAn expression statement  is an expression terminated by a semicolon. Any value\\nreturned by the expression is discarded. Only certain types of expressions have\\nmeaning as statements:\\n• Assignments (§5.6, p. 158)\\n• Increment and decrement operators (§5.9, p. 176)\\n• Method calls (§3.5, p. 72)\\n• Object creation expressions with the new operator (§5.17, p. 195)\\nA solitary semicolon denotes the empty statement , which does nothing.\\nA block, {}, is a compound  statement that can be used to group zero or more local dec-\\nlarations and statements (§4.4, p. 117). Blocks can be nested, since a block is a state-\\nment that can contain other statements. A block can be used in any context where a\\nsimple statement is permitted. The compound statement that is embodied in a block\\nbegins at the left brace, {, and ends with a matching right brace, }. Such a block must\\nnot be confused with an array initializer in declaration statements (§3.4, p. 60). \\nLabeled statements are discussed in §6.4 on page 220.\\nInstance Methods and the Object Reference this\\nInstance methods belong to every object of the class and can be invoked only on\\nobjects. All members defined in the class, both static and non-static, are accessible\\nin the context of an instance method. The reason is that all instance methods are\\npassed an implicit reference to the current object —that is, the object on which the\\nmethod is being invoked. The current object can be referenced in the body of the\\ninstance method by the keyword this. In the body of the method, the this reference\\ncan be used like any other object reference to access members of the object. In fact,\\nthe keyword this can be used in any non-static context. The this reference can be\\nused as a normal reference to reference the current object, but the reference cannot\\nbe modified—it is a final  reference (§4.8, p. 133).\\nThe this reference to the current object is useful in situations where a local variable\\nhides, or shadows , a field with the same name. In Example 3.1, the two parameters\\nnoOfWatts  and indicator  in the constructor of the Light  class have the same names\\nas the fields in the class. The exam ple also declares a local variable location , which\\nhas the same name as one of the fields. The reference this can be used to distin-\\nguish the fields from the local variables. At (1), the this reference is used to identify\\nthe field noOfWatts , which is assigned the value of the parameter noOfWatts . Without\\nthe this reference at (2), the value of the parameter indicator  is assigned back to3.2: METHOD DECLARATIONS 51\\nthis parameter, and not to the field by the same name, resulting in a logical error.\\nSimilarly at (3), without the this reference, it is the local variable location  that is\\nassigned the value of the parameter site, and not the field with the same name.\\nExample 3.1 Using the this Reference\\npublic class Light {\\n  // Fields:\\n  int     noOfWatts;      // Wattage\\n  boolean indicator;      // On or off\\n  String  location;       // Placement\\n  // Constructor\\n  public Light(int noOfWatts, boolean indicator, String site) {\\n    String location;\\n    this.noOfWatts = noOfWatts;   // (1) Assignment to field\\n    indicator = indicator;        // (2) Assignment to parameter\\n    location = site;              // (3) Assignment to local variable\\n    this.superfluous();           // (4)\\n    superfluous();                // equivalent to call at (4)\\n  }\\n  public void superfluous() {\\n    System.out.printf(\"Current object: %s%n\", this); // (5)\\n  }\\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\\n    Light light = new Light(100, true, \"loft\");\\n    System.out.println(\"No. of watts: \" + light.noOfWatts);\\n    System.out.println(\"Indicator:    \" + light.indicator);\\n    System.out.println(\"Location:     \" + light.location);\\n  }\\n}\\nProbable output from the program:\\nCurrent object: Light@1bc4459\\nCurrent object: Light@1bc4459\\nNo. of watts: 100\\nIndicator:    false\\nLocation:     null\\nIf a member is not shadowed by a local declaration, the simple name member  is con-\\nsidered a short-hand notation for this.member . In particular, the this reference can\\nbe used explicitly to invoke other methods in the class. This usage is illustrated at (4)\\nin Example 3.1, where the method superfluous()  is called.\\nIf, for some reason, a method needs to pass the current object to another method,\\nit can do so using the this reference. This approach is illustrated at (5) in Example 3.1,\\nwhere the current object is passed to the printf()  method. The printf()  method52 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\nprints the string representation of the current object (which comprises the name of\\nthe class of the current object and the he xadecimal representation of the current\\nobject’s hash code). (The hash code  of an object is an int value that can be used to\\nstore and retrieve the object from special data structures called hash tables .)\\nNote that the this reference cannot be used in a static context, as static code is not\\nexecuted in the context of any object.\\nMethod Overloading\\nEach method has a signature , which comprises the name of the method plus the\\ntypes and order of the parameters in th e formal parameter list. Several method\\nimplementations may have the same name, as long as the method signatures differ.\\nThis practice is called method overloading . Because overloaded methods have the\\nsame name, their parameter lists must be different.\\nRather than inventing new method na mes, method overloading can be used\\nwhen the same logical operation requires multiple implementations. The Java SE\\nplatform API makes heavy use of method overloading. For example, the class\\njava.lang.Math  contains an overloaded method min() , which returns the minimum\\nof two numeric values.\\npublic static double min(double a, double b)\\npublic static float min(float a, float b)\\npublic static int min(int a, int b)\\npublic static long min(long a, long b)\\nIn the following examples, five implementations of the method methodA  are shown:\\nvoid methodA(int a, double b) { /* ... */ }      // (1)\\nint  methodA(int a)           { return a; }      // (2)\\nint  methodA()                { return 1; }      // (3)\\nlong methodA(double a, int b) { return b; }      // (4)\\nlong methodA(int x, double y) { return x; }      // (5) Not OK.\\nThe corresponding signatures of the five methods are as follows:\\nThe first four implementations of the method named methodA  are overloaded cor-\\nrectly, each time with a different parameter list and, therefore, different signatures.\\nThe declaration at (5) has the same signature methodA(int, double)  as the declara-\\ntion at (1) and, therefore, is not a valid overloading of this method. \\nvoid bake(Cake k)  { /* ... */ }                 // (1)\\nvoid bake(Pizza p) { /* ... */ }                 // (2)\\nint     halfIt(int a) { return a/2; }            // (3)\\ndouble  halfIt(int a) { return a/2.0; }          // (4) Not OK. Same signature.methodA(int, double) 1\\'\\nmethodA(int) 2\\': Number of parameters\\nmethodA() 3\\': Number of parameters\\nmethodA(double, int) 4\\': Order of parameters\\nmethodA(int, double) 5\\': Same as 1\\'3.3: CONSTRUCTORS 53\\nThe method named bake is correctly overloaded at (1) and (2), with two different\\nparameter lists. In the implementation, changing just the return type (as shown at\\n(3) and (4) in the preceding example), is not enough to overload a method, and will\\nbe flagged as a compile-time error. The parameter list in the declarations must be\\ndifferent. \\nOnly methods declared in the same class an d those that are inherited by the class can\\nbe overloaded. Overloaded methods should be considered to be individual methods\\nthat just happen to have the same name. Methods with the same name are allowed,\\nsince methods are identified by their signature. At compile time, the right implemen-\\ntation of an overloaded method is chosen, based on the signature of the method call.\\nDetails of method overloading resolution can be found in §7.10 on page 316. Method\\noverloading should not be confused with method overriding  (§7.2, p. 268).\\n3.3 Constructors \\nThe main purpose of constructors is to set the initial state of an object, when the\\nobject is created by using the new operator.\\nFor the purpose of this book, we will use the following simplified syntax of a con-\\nstructor:\\naccessibility_modifier  class_name  (formal_parameter_list )\\n                            throws_clause  // Constructor header\\n{ // Constructor body\\nlocal_variable_declarations\\nstatements\\n}\\nConstructor declarations are very much like method declarations. However, the\\nfollowing restrictions on constructors should be noted:\\n• Modifiers other than an accessibility modifier are not permitted in the con-\\nstructor header. For accessibility modifiers for constructors, see §4.7, p. 123.\\n• Constructors cannot return a value and, therefore, do not specify a return type,\\nnot even void, in the constructor header. But their declaration can use the return\\nstatement that does not return a value in the constructor body (§6.4, p. 224).\\n• The constructor name must be the same as the class name.\\nClass names and method names exist in different namespaces . Thus, there are no\\nname conflicts in Example 3.2, where a method declared at (2) has the same name\\nas the constructor declared at (1). A method must always specify a return type,\\nwhereas a constructor does not. However, using such naming schemes is strongly\\ndiscouraged.\\nA constructor that has no parameters, like the one at (1) in Example 3.2, is called a\\nno-argument constructor .54 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\nExample 3.2 Namespaces\\npublic class Name {\\n  Name() {                      // (1) No-argument constructor\\n    System.out.println(\"Constructor\");\\n  }\\n  void Name() {                 // (2) Instance method\\n    System.out.println(\"Method\");\\n  }\\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\\n    new Name().Name();          // (3) Constructor call followed by method call\\n  }\\n}\\nOutput from the program:\\nConstructor\\nMethod\\nThe Default Constructor\\nIf a class does not specify any constructors, then a default constructor  is generated\\nfor the class by the compiler. The default co nstructor is equivalent to the following\\nimplementation:\\nclass_name () { super();  }   // No parameters. Calls superclass constructor.\\nA default constructor is a no-argument constructor. The only action taken by the\\ndefault constructor is to call the superclass constructor. This ensures that the inher-\\nited state of the object is initialized prop erly (§7.5, p. 282). In addition, all instance\\nvariables in the object are set to the default value of their type, barring those that\\nare initialized by an initialization expression in their declaration.\\nIn the following code, the class Light  does not specify any constructors:\\nclass Light {\\n  // Fields:\\n  int     noOfWatts;       // Wattage\\n  boolean indicator;       // On or off\\n  String  location;        // Placement\\n  // No constructors\\n  //...\\n}\\nclass Greenhouse {\\n  // ...\\n  Light oneLight = new Light();     // (1) Call to default constructor\\n}3.3: CONSTRUCTORS 55\\nIn this code, the following default constructor is called when a Light  object is cre-\\nated by the object creation expression at (1):\\nLight() { super(); }\\nCreating an object using the new operator with the default constructor, as at (1), will\\ninitialize the fields of the object to th eir default values (that is, the fields noOfWatts ,\\nindicator , and location  in a Light  object will be initialized to 0, false , and null,\\nrespectively).\\nA class can choose to provide its own constructors, rather than relying on the default\\nconstructor. In the following example, the class Light  provides a no-argument con-\\nstructor at (1).\\nclass Light {\\n  // ...\\n  Light() {                        // (1) No-argument constructor\\n    noOfWatts = 50;\\n    indicator = true;\\n    location  = \"X\";\\n  }\\n  //...\\n}\\nclass Greenhouse {\\n  // ...\\n  Light extraLight = new Light();   // (2) Call of explicit default constructor\\n}\\nThe no-argument constructor ensures that any object created with the object cre-\\nation expression new Light() , as at (2), will have its fields noOfWatts , indicator , and\\nlocation  initialized to 50, true, and \"X\", respectively.\\nIf a class defines any constructor, it can no longer rely on the default constructor to\\nset the state of its objects. If such a class requires a no-argument constructor, it must\\nprovide its own implementation, as in the preceding example. In the next example\\nthe class Light  does not provide a no-argument constructor, but rather includes a\\nnon-zero argument constructor at (1). It is called at (2) when an object of the class\\nLight  is created with the new operator. Any attempt to call the default constructor\\nwill be flagged as a compile-time error, as shown at (3).\\nclass Light {\\n  // ...\\n  // Only non-zero argument constructor:\\n  Light(int noOfWatts, boolean indicator, String location) {          // (1)\\n    this.noOfWatts = noOfWatts;\\n    this.indicator = indicator;\\n    this.location  = location;\\n  }\\n  //...\\n}\\nclass Greenhouse {\\n  // ...\\n  Light moreLight  = new Light(100, true, \"Greenhouse\");// (2) OK\\n  Light firstLight = new Light();                       // (3) Compile-time error\\n}56 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\nOverloaded Constructors\\nLike methods, constructors can be overloaded. Since the constructors in a class all\\nhave the same name as the class, their si gnatures are differenti ated by their param-\\neter lists. In the following example, the class Light  now provides explicit imple-\\nmentation of the no-argument constructor at (1) and that of a non-zero argument\\nconstructor at (2). The constructors are overloaded, as is evident by their signa-\\ntures. The non-zero argument constructor at (2) is called when an object of the class\\nLight  is created at (3), and the no-argument constructor is likewise called at (4).\\nOverloading of constructors allows appropriate initialization of objects on\\ncreation, depending on the constructor invoked (see chaining of constructors in\\n§7.5, p. 282). It is recommended to use the @param  tag in a Javadoc comment to doc-\\nument the formal parameters of a constructor. \\nclass Light {\\n  // ...\\n  // No-argument constructor:\\n  Light() {                                                  // (1)\\n    noOfWatts = 50;\\n    indicator = true;\\n    location  = \"X\";\\n  }\\n  // Non-zero argument constructor:\\n  Light(int noOfWatts, boolean indicator, String location) { // (2)\\n    this.noOfWatts = noOfWatts;\\n    this.indicator = indicator;\\n    this.location  = location;\\n  }\\n  //...\\n}\\nclass Greenhouse {\\n  // ...\\n  Light moreLight  = new Light(100, true, \"Greenhouse\");     // (3) OK\\n  Light firstLight = new Light();                            // (4) OK\\n}\\nReview Questions\\n3.1 Which one of these declarations is a valid method declaration?\\nSelect the one correct answer.\\n(a)void method1         { /* ... */ }\\n(b)void method2()       { /* ... */ }\\n(c)void method3(void)   { /* ... */ }\\n(d)method4()            { /* ... */ }\\n(e)method5(void)        { /* ... */ }3.3: CONSTRUCTORS 57\\n3.2 Which statements, when inserted at (1), will not result in compile-time errors?\\npublic class ThisUsage {\\n  int planets;\\n  static int suns;\\n  public void gaze() {\\n    int i;\\n    // (1) INSERT STATEMENT HERE\\n  }\\n}\\nSelect the three correct answers.\\n(a)i = this.planets;\\n(b)i = this.suns;\\n(c)this = new ThisUsage();\\n(d)this.i = 4;\\n(e)this.suns = planets;\\n3.3 Given the following pairs of method declarations, which statements are true?\\nvoid fly(int distance) {}\\nint  fly(int time, int speed) { return time*speed; }\\nvoid fall(int time) {}\\nint  fall(int distance) { return distance; }\\nvoid glide(int time) {}\\nvoid Glide(int time) {}\\nSelect the two correct answers.\\n(a) The first pair of methods will compile, and overload the method name fly.\\n(b) The second pair of methods will compile, and overload the method name\\nfall.\\n(c) The third pair of methods will compile, and overload the method name glide .\\n(d) The first pair of methods will not compile.\\n(e) The second pair of methods will not compile.\\n(f) The third pair of methods will not compile.\\n3.4 Given a class named Book, which one of these constructor declarations is valid for\\nthe class Book?\\nSelect the one correct answer.\\n(a)Book(Book b) {}\\n(b)Book Book() {}\\n(c)private final Book() {}\\n(d)void Book() {}\\n(e)public static void Book(String[] args) {}\\n(f)abstract Book() {}58 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\n3.5 Which statements are true?\\nSelect the two correct answers.\\n(a) A class must define a constructor.\\n(b) A constructor can be declared private .\\n(c) A constructor can return a value.\\n(d) A constructor must initialize all fields when a class is instantiated.\\n(e) A constructor can access the non-static members of a class.\\n3.6 What will be the result of compiling the following program?\\npublic class MyClass {\\n  long var;\\n  public void MyClass(long param) { var = param; }  // (1)\\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\\n    MyClass a, b;\\n    a = new MyClass();                              // (2)\\n    b = new MyClass(5);                             // (3)\\n  }\\n}\\nSelect the one correct answer.\\n(a) A compile-time error will occur at (1).\\n(b) A compile-time error will occur at (2).\\n(c) A compile-time error will occur at (3).\\n(d) The program will compile without errors.\\n3.4 Arrays\\nAn array  is a data structure that defines an indexed collection of a fixed number of\\nhomogeneous data elements. This means th at all elements in the array have the\\nsame data type. A position in the array is indicated by a non-negative integer value\\ncalled the index . An element at a given position in the array is accessed using the\\nindex. The size of an array is fixed and cannot be changed after the array has been\\ncreated.\\nIn Java, arrays are objects. Arrays can be of primitive data types or reference types.\\nIn the former case, all elements in the arra y are of a specific primitive data type. In\\nthe latter case, all elements are references of a specific reference type. References in\\nthe array can then denote objects of this reference type or its subtypes. Each array\\nobject has a public  final  field called length , which specifies the array size (i.e., the\\nnumber of elements the array can accomm odate). The first element is always at\\nindex 0 and the last element at index n – 1, where n is the value of the length  field\\nin the array.3.4: ARRAYS 59\\nSimple arrays are one-dimensional arrays —that is, a simple list of values. Since\\narrays can store reference values, the obje cts referenced can also be array objects.\\nThus, multidimensional arrays are implemented as array of arrays .\\nPassing array references as parameters is discussed in §3.5, p. 72. Type conversions\\nfor array references on assignment and on method invocation are discussed in\\n§7.7, p. 309.\\nDeclaring Array Variables\\nA one-dimensional array variable declaration has either of the following syntaxes:\\nelement_type [] array_name ;\\nor \\nelement_type  array_name [];\\nwhere element_type  can be a primitive data type or a reference type. The array vari-\\nable array_name  has the type element_type []. Note that the array size is not speci-\\nfied. As a consequence, the array variable array_name  can be assigned the reference\\nvalue of an array of any length, as long as its elements have element_type.\\nIt is important to understand that the declaration does not actually create an array.\\nInstead, it simply declares a reference  that can refer to an array object. The [] nota-\\ntion can also be specified after a variable name to declare it as an array variable,\\nbut then it applies to just that variable.\\nint anIntArray[], oneInteger;\\nPizza[] mediumPizzas, largePizzas;\\nThese two declarations declare anIntArray  and mediumPizzas  to be reference variables\\nthat can refer to arrays of int values and arrays of Pizza  objects, respectively. The\\nvariable largePizzas  can denote an array of Pizza  objects, but the variable oneInteger\\ncannot denote an array of int values—it is a simple variable of the type int.\\nAn array variable that is declared as a field in a class, but is not explicitly initialized\\nto any array, will be initialized to the default reference value null. This default ini-\\ntialization does not apply to local reference variables and, therefore, does not apply\\nto local array variables either (§2.4, p. 42). This behavior should not be confused\\nwith initialization of the elements of an array during array construction.\\nConstructing an Array\\nAn array can be constructed for a fixed number of elements of a specific type, using\\nthe new operator. The reference value of the resulting array can be assigned to an\\narray variable of the correspo nding type. The syntax of the array creation expression\\nis shown on the right-hand side of the following assignment statement:\\narray_name  = new element_type [array_size ];60 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\nThe minimum value of array_size  is 0; in other words zero-length arrays can be con-\\nstructed in Java. If the array size is negative, a NegativeArraySizeException  is thrown\\nat runtime.\\nGiven the declarations\\nint anIntArray[], oneInteger;\\nPizza[] mediumPizzas, largePizzas;\\nthe three arrays in the declaratio ns can be constructed as follows:\\nanIntArray   = new int[10];          // array for 10 integers\\nmediumPizzas = new Pizza[5];         // array of 5 pizzas\\nlargePizzas  = new Pizza[3];         // array of 3 pizzas\\nThe array declaration and construction can be combined.\\nelement_type1[] array_name  = new element_type2[array_size ];\\nIn the preceding syntax, the array type element_type2[] must be assignable  to the\\narray type element_type1[] (§7.7, p. 309). When the array is constructed, all of its ele-\\nments are initialized to the default value for element_type2. This is true for both\\nmember and local arrays when they are constructed.\\nIn the next examples, the code constructs the array, and the array elements are\\nimplicitly initialized to their default valu es. For example, all elements of the array\\nanIntArray  get the value 0, and all elements of the array mediumPizzas  get the value\\nnull when the arrays are constructed.\\nint[] anIntArray = new int[10];                  // Default element value: 0\\nPizza[] mediumPizzas = new Pizza[5];             // Default element value: null\\nThe value of the field length  in each array is set to the number of elements specified\\nduring the construction of the array; for example, mediumPizzas.length  has the\\nvalue 5.\\nOnce an array has been constructed, its elements can also be explicitly initialized\\nindividually—for example, in a loop. The examples in the rest of this section make\\nuse of a loop to traverse the elemen ts of an array for various purposes.\\nInitializing an Array\\nJava provides the means of declaring, constructing, and explicitly initializing an\\narray in one declaration statement:\\nelement_type [] array_name  = { array_initialize_list  };\\nThis form of initialization applies to fields as well as to local arrays. The\\narray_initialize_list  is a comma-separated list of zero or more expressions. Such an\\narray initializer results in the constr uction and initialization of the array.\\nint[] anIntArray = {13, 49, 267, 15, 215};\\nIn this declaration statement, the variable anIntArray  is declared as a reference to\\nan array of ints. The array initializer results in the construction of an array to hold3.4: ARRAYS 61\\nfive elements (equal to the length of the list of expressions in the block), where the\\nfirst element is initialized to th e value of the first expression ( 13), the second ele-\\nment to the value of the second expression ( 49), and so on.\\nPizza[] pizzaOrder = { new Pizza(), new Pizza(), null };\\nIn this declaration statement, the variable pizzaOrder  is declared as a reference to an\\narray of Pizza  objects. The array initializer constructs an array to hold three ele-\\nments. The initialization code sets the firs t two elements of the array to refer to two\\nPizza  objects, while the last element is initialized to the null reference. The refer-\\nence value of the array of Pizza  objects is assigned to the reference pizzaOrder . Note\\nalso that this declaration statement actually creates three  objects: the array object\\nwith three references and the two Pizza  objects.\\nThe expressions in the array_initialize_list  are evaluated from left to right, and the\\narray name obviously cannot occur in any of the expressions in the list. In the pre-\\nceding examples, the array_initialize_list  is terminated by the right brace, }, of the\\nblock. The list can also be legally terminated by a comma. The following array has\\nlength 2, and not 3:\\nTopping[] pizzaToppings = { new Topping(\"cheese\"), new Topping(\"tomato\"), };\\nThe declaration statement at (1) in the following code defines an array of four\\nString  objects, while the declaration statement at (2) shows that a String  object is\\nnot the same as an array of char.\\n// Array with 4 String objects:\\nString[] pets = {\"crocodiles\", \"elephants\", \"crocophants\", \"elediles\"}; // (1)\\n// Array of 3 characters:\\nchar[] charArray = {\\'a\\', \\'h\\', \\'a\\'};    // (2) Not the same as \"aha\"\\nUsing an Array\\nThe array object is referenced by the arra y name, but individual array elements are\\naccessed by specifying an index with the [] operator. The array element access\\nexpression has the following syntax:\\narray_name [index_expression ]\\nEach individual element is treated as a simple variable of the element type. The\\nindex  is specified by the index_expression , whose value should be promotable to an\\nint value; otherwise, a compile-time error is flagged. Since the lower bound of an\\narray index is always 0, the upper bound is 1 less than the array size—that is,\\narray_name .length-1 . The ith element in the array has index (i-1) . At runtime, the\\nindex value is automatically checked to ensu re that it is within the array index\\nbounds. If the index value is less than 0, or greater than or equal to\\narray_name .length , an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException  is thrown. A program can\\neither check the index explicitly or catch the runtime exception (§6.5, p. 230), but\\nan illegal index is typically an indication of a programming error.62 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\nIn the array element access expression, the array_name  can be any expression that\\nreturns a reference to an array. For example, the expression on the right-hand side\\nof the following assignment statement returns the character \\'H\\' at index 1 in the\\ncharacter array returned by a call to the toCharArray()  method of the String  class:\\nchar letter = \"AHA\".toCharArray()[1];     // \\'H\\'\\nThe array operator [] is used to declare array types ( Topping[] ), specify the array\\nsize (new Topping[3] ), and access array elements ( toppings[1] ). This operator is not\\nused when the array reference is manipulate d, such as in an array reference assign-\\nment (§7.9, p. 312), or when the array reference is passed as an actual parameter in\\na method call (§3.5, p. 77).\\nExample 3.3 shows traversal of arrays using for loops (§6.3, p. 215 and p. 217). A\\nfor(;;)  loop at (3) in the main()  method initializes the local array trialArray\\ndeclared at (2) five times with pseudo-random numbers (from 0.0 to 100.0 ), by call-\\ning the method randomize()  declared at (5). The minimum value in the array is\\nfound by calling the method findMinimum()  declared at (6), and is stored in the array\\nstoreMinimum  declared at (1). Both of these methods also use a for(;;)  loop. The loop\\nvariable is initialized to a start value— 0 in (3) and (5), and 1 in (6). The loop condi-\\ntion tests whether the loop variable is less than the length of the array; this guar-\\nantees that the loop will terminate when the last element has been accessed. The\\nloop variable is incremented after each iteration to access the next element.\\nA for(:)  loop at (4) in the main()  method is used to print the minimum values from\\nthe trials, as elements are read consecutively from the array, without keeping track\\nof an index value. \\nExample 3.3 Using Arrays\\npublic class Trials {\\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\\n    // Declare and construct the local arrays:\\n    double[] storeMinimum = new double[5];               // (1)\\n    double[] trialArray = new double[15];                // (2)\\n    for (int i = 0; i < storeMinimum.length; ++i) {      // (3)\\n      // Initialize the array.\\n      randomize(trialArray);\\n      // Find and store the minimum value.\\n      storeMinimum[i] = findMinimum(trialArray);\\n    }\\n    // Print the minimum values:                            (4)\\n    for (double minValue : storeMinimum)\\n      System.out.printf(\"%.4f%n\", minValue);\\n  }\\n  public static void randomize(double[] valArray) {      // (5)\\n    for (int i = 0; i < valArray.length; ++i)\\n      valArray[i] = Math.random() * 100.0;\\n  }3.4: ARRAYS 63\\n  public static double findMinimum(double[] valArray) {  // (6)\\n    // Assume the array has at least one element.\\n    double minValue = valArray[0];\\n    for (int i = 1; i < valArray.length; ++i)\\n      minValue = Math.min(minValue, valArray[i]);\\n    return minValue;\\n  }\\n}\\nProbable output from the program:\\n6.9330\\n2.7819\\n6.7427\\n18.0849\\n26.2462\\nAnonymous Arrays\\nAs shown earlier in this section, the following declaration statement can be used\\nto construct arrays using an array creation expression:\\nelement_type1[] array_name  = new element_type2[array_size ];   // (1)\\nint[] intArray = new int[5];\\nThe size of the array is specified in the array creation expression, which creates the\\narray and initializes the array elements to their default values. By comparison, the fol-\\nlowing declaration statement both create s the array and initializes the array ele-\\nments to specific values given in the array initializer:\\nelement_type [] array_name  = { array_initialize_list  };           // (2)\\nint[] intArray = {3, 5, 2, 8, 6};\\nHowever, the array initializer is not an expression. Java has another array creation\\nexpression, called an anonymous array , which allows the concept of the array cre-\\nation expression from (1) to be combined with the array initializer from (2), so as\\nto create and initialize an array object: \\nnew element_type [] { array_initialize_list  }\\nnew int[] {3, 5, 2, 8, 6}\\nThis construct has enough information to create a nameless array of a specific type.\\nNeither the name of the array nor the size of the array is specified. The construct\\nreturns the reference value of the newly crea ted array, which can be assigned to ref-\\nerences and passed as argument in method calls. In particular, the following dec-\\nlaration statements are equivalent:\\nint[] intArray = {3, 5, 2, 8, 6};                               // (1)\\nint[] intArray = new int[] {3, 5, 2, 8, 6};                     // (2)64 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\nIn (1), an array initializer is used to cr eate and initialize the elements. In (2), an\\nanonymous array expression is used. It is tempting to use the array initializer as an\\nexpression—for example, in an assignment statement, as a shortcut for assigning\\nvalues to array elements in one go. However, this is illegal; instead, an anonymous\\narray expression should be used. The concept of the anonymous array combines\\nthe definition and the creation of the array into one operation.\\nint[] daysInMonth;\\ndaysInMonth = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, \\n               31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};                   // Compile-time error\\ndaysInMonth = new int[] {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31}; // OK\\nIn Example 3.4, an anonymous array is constructed at (1), and passed as an actual\\nparameter to the static method findMinimum()  defined at (2). Note that no array\\nname or array size is specified for the anonymous array.\\nExample 3.4 Using Anonymous Arrays\\npublic class AnonArray {\\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\\n    System.out.println(\"Minimum value: \" +\\n        findMinimum(new int[] {3, 5, 2, 8, 6}));                   // (1)\\n  }\\n  public static int findMinimum(int[] dataSeq) {                   // (2)\\n    // Assume the array has at least one element.\\n    int min = dataSeq[0];\\n    for (int index = 1; index < dataSeq.length; ++index)\\n      if (dataSeq[index] < min)\\n        min = dataSeq[index];\\n    return min;\\n  }\\n}\\nOutput from the program:\\nMinimum value: 2\\nMultidimensional Arrays\\nSince an array element can be an object reference and arrays are objects, array\\nelements can themselves refer to other arrays. In Java, an array of arrays can be\\ndefined as follows:\\nelement_type [][]...[]  array_name ;\\nor \\nelement_type  array_name [][]...[];3.4: ARRAYS 65\\nIn fact, the sequence of square bracket pairs, [], indicating the number of dimen-\\nsions, can be distributed as a postfix to both the element type and the array name.\\nArrays of arrays are often called multidimensional arrays .\\nThe following declarations are all equivalent:\\nint[][] mXnArray;      // 2-dimensional array\\nint[]   mXnArray[];    // 2-dimensional array\\nint     mXnArray[][];  // 2-dimensional array\\nIt is customary to combine the declaration with the construction of the multi-\\ndimensional array.\\nint[][] mXnArray = new int[4][5];    // 4 x 5 matrix of ints\\nThe previous declaration constructs an array mXnArray  of four elements, where each\\nelement is an array (row) of five int values. The concept of rows and columns is often\\nused to describe the dimensions of a 2-dimensional array, which is often called a\\nmatrix . However, such an interpretation is not dictated by the Java language. \\nEach row in the previous matrix is denoted by mXnArray[i] , where 0 \\uf0a3 i \\uf03c 4. Each\\nelement in the ith row, mXnArray[i] , is accessed by mXnArray[i][j] , where 0 \\uf0a3 j \\uf03c 5.\\nThe number of rows is given by mXnArray.length , in this case 4, and the number of\\nvalues in the ith row is given by mXnArray[i].length , in this case 5 for all the rows,\\nwhere 0 \\uf0a3 i \\uf03c 4.\\nMultidimensional arrays can also be constructed and explicitly initialized using\\nthe array initializers discussed for simple arrays. Note that each row is an array\\nthat uses an array initializer to specify its values:\\ndouble[][] identityMatrix = {\\n  {1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 }, // 1. row\\n  {0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0 }, // 2. row\\n  {0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0 }, // 3. row\\n  {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 }  // 4. row \\n}; // 4 x 4 floating-point matrix\\nArrays in a multidimensional array need not have the same length; when they do\\nnot, they are called ragged arrays . The array of arrays pizzaGalore  in the following\\ncode has five rows; the first four rows have  different lengths but the fifth row is left\\nunconstructed:\\nPizza[][] pizzaGalore = {\\n  { new Pizza(), null, new Pizza() },    // 1. row is an array of 3 elements.\\n  { null, new Pizza()},                  // 2. row is an array of 2 elements.\\n  new Pizza[1],                          // 3. row is an array of 1 element.\\n  {},                                    // 4. row is an array of 0 elements.\\n  null                                   // 5. row is not constructed.\\n};\\nWhen constructing multidimensional arrays with the new operator, the length of\\nthe deeply nested arrays may be omitted. In such a case, these arrays are left\\nunconstructed. For example, an array of arrays to represent a room on a floor in a\\nhotel on a street in a city can have the type HotelRoom[][][][] . From left to right, the66 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\nsquare brackets represent indices for street, hotel, floor, and room, respectively.\\nThis 4-dimensional array of arrays can be constructed piecemeal, starting with the\\nleftmost dimension and proceeding to the rightmost successively. \\nHotelRoom[][][][] rooms = new HotelRoom[10][5][][];  // Just streets and hotels. \\nThe preceding declaration constructs the array of arrays rooms  partially with ten\\nstreets, where each street has five hotels. Floors and rooms can be added to a par-\\nticular hotel on a particular street:\\nrooms[0][0]       = new HotelRoom[3][]; // 3 floors in 1st hotel on 1st street.\\nrooms[0][0][0]    = new HotelRoom[8];   // 8 rooms on 1st floor in this hotel.\\nrooms[0][0][0][0] = new HotelRoom();    // Initializes 1st room on this floor.\\nThe next code snippet constructs an array of arrays matrix , where the first row has\\none element, the second row has two elements, and the third row has three\\nelements. Note that the outer array is co nstructed first. The second dimension is\\nconstructed in a loop that constructs the array in each row. The elements in the\\nmultidimensional array will be implicitly initialized to the default double  value\\n(0.0D). In Figure 3.1, the array of arrays matrix  is depicted after the elements have\\nbeen explicitly initialized.\\ndouble[][] matrix = new double[3][];      // Number of rows.\\nfor (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; ++i)\\n  matrix[i] = new double[i + 1];          // Construct a row.\\nTwo other ways of initializing such an array of arrays are shown next. The first\\napproach uses array initializers, and the second uses an anonymous array of arrays.\\ndouble[][] matrix2 = {    // Using array initializers.\\n  {0.0},                  // 1. row\\n  {0.0, 0.0},             // 2. row\\n  {0.0, 0.0, 0.0}         // 3. row\\n};\\ndouble[][] matrix3 = new double[][] { // Using an anonymous array of arrays.\\n  {0.0},                  // 1. row\\n  {0.0, 0.0},             // 2. row\\n  {0.0, 0.0, 0.0}         // 3. row\\n};\\nThe type of the variable matrix  is double[][] , a two-dimensional array of double  val-\\nues. The type of the variable matrix[i]  (where 0 \\uf0a3\\uf020i\\uf03c\\uf020matrix.length ) is double[] , a\\none-dimensional array of double  values. The type of the variable matrix[i][j]\\n(where 0 \\uf0a3\\uf020i\\uf03c\\uf020matrix.length  and 0 \\uf0a3\\uf020j\\uf03c\\uf020matrix[i].length ) is double , a simple variable\\nof type double .\\nNested loops are a natural match for manipulating multidimensional arrays. In\\nExample 3.5, a rectangular 4 \\uf0b4 3 int matrix is declared and constructed at (1). The\\nprogram finds the minimum value in the matrix. The outer loop at (2) traverses the\\nrows (mXnArray[i] , where 0 \\uf0a3\\uf020i\\uf03c\\uf020mXnArray.length ), and the inner loop at (3) traverses\\nthe elements in each row in turn ( mXnArray[i][j] , where 0 \\uf0a3\\uf020j\\uf03c\\uf020mXnArray[i].length ).\\nThe outer loop is executed mXnArray.length  times, or 4 times, and the inner loop is3.4: ARRAYS 67\\nexecuted \\uf020(mXnArray.length ) \\uf0b4 (mXnArray[i].length ), or 12 times, since all rows have\\nthe same length 3.\\nThe for(:)  loop also provides a safe and convenient way of traversing an array.\\nSeveral examples of its use are provided in §6.3, p. 217.\\nExample 3.5 Using Multidimensional Arrays\\npublic class MultiArrays {\\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\\n    // Declare and construct the M X N matrix.\\n    int[][] mXnArray = {                                           // (1)\\n        {16,  7, 12}, // 1. row\\n        { 9, 20, 18}, // 2. row\\n        {14, 11,  5}, // 3. row\\n        { 8,  5, 10}  // 4. row\\n    }; // 4 x 3 int matrix\\n    // Find the minimum value in a M X N matrix:\\n    int min = mXnArray[0][0];\\n    for (int i = 0; i < mXnArray.length; ++i)                      // (2)\\n      // Find min in mXnArray[i], in the row given by index i:\\n      for (int j = 0; j < mXnArray[i].length; ++j)                 // (3)\\n        min = Math.min(min, mXnArray[i][j]);\\n    System.out.println(\"Minimum value: \" + min);\\n  }\\n}\\nOutput from the program:\\nMinimum value: 5Figure 3.1 Array of Arrays\\nmatrix:double[][] \\n[0] :Ref(double[]) \\n[1] :Ref(double[]) \\n[2] length = 3 \\nmatrix[2]:double[] \\n[0] 1.5 \\n[1] 2.9 \\n[2] 5.5 length = 3 matrix[1]:double[] \\n[0] 6.3 \\n[1] 4.4 length = 2 \\nmatrix[2][1] matrix[0]:double[] \\n[0] 8.5 length = 1 \\n:Ref(double[])68 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\nSorting Arrays\\nSorting implies ordering the elements according to some ranking criteria, usually\\nbased on the values  of the elements. The values of numeric data types can be com-\\npared and ranked by using the relational operators. For comparing objects of a\\nclass, the class typically implements the compareTo()  method of the Comparable  inter-\\nf a c e .  T h e  o r d e r i n g  d e f i n e d  b y  t h i s  m e t h o d  i s  c a l l e d  t h e  natural ordering  for the\\nobjects of the class. The wrapper classes for primitive values and the String  class\\nimplement the compareTo()  method (§8.3, p. 350, and §8.4, p. 363, respectively).\\nThe java.util.Arrays  class provides many overloaded versions of the sort()\\nmethod to sort practically any type of array. \\nAn appropriate import  statement should be included in the source code to access\\nthe java.util.Arrays  class. In the next code snippet, an array of strings is sorted\\naccording to natural ordering for strings—that is, based on the Unicode values of\\nthe characters in the strings:\\nString[] strArray =  {\"biggest\", \"big\", \"bigger\", \"Bigfoot\"};\\nArrays.sort(strArray);    // Natural ordering: [Bigfoot, big, bigger, biggest]\\nThe next examples illustrate sorting an array of primitive values ( int) at (1), and an\\narray of type Object  containing mutually comparable elements ( String ) at (2). In (3),\\nthe numerical values are autoboxed into their corresponding wrapper classes (§8.3,\\np. 346), but the objects of different wrapper classes and the String  class are not\\nmutually comparable. In (4), the numerical values are also autoboxed into their\\ncorresponding wrapper classes, but again the objects of different wrapper classes\\nare not mutually comparable. A ClassCastException  is thrown when the elements\\nare not mutually comparable.\\nint[] intArray = {5, 3, 7, 1};              // int\\nArrays.sort(intArray);                      // (1) Natural ordering: [1, 3, 5, 7]\\nObject[] objArray1 = {\"I\", \"am\", \"OK\"};     // String\\nArrays.sort(objArray1);                     // (2) Natural ordering: [I, OK, am]\\nObject[] objArray2 = {23, \"ten\", 3.14};     // Not mutually comparable\\nArrays.sort(objArray2);                     // (3) ClassCastException\\nNumber[] numbers = {23, 3.14, 10L};         // Not mutually comparable\\nArrays.sort(numbers);                       // (4) ClassCastExceptionvoid sort( type[] array)\\nPermitted type for elements includes byte, char, double , float , int, long, short , and\\nObject . The method sorts the elements in the array according to their natural\\nordering . In the case of an array of objects being passed as argument, the objects\\nmust be mutually comparable ; that is, it should be possible to compare any two\\nobjects in the array according to the natural ordering defined by the compareTo()\\nmethod of the Comparable  interface.3.4: ARRAYS 69\\nSearching Arrays\\nA common operation on an array is to search  the array for a given element, called the\\nkey. The java.util.Arrays  class provides overloaded versions of the binarySearch()\\nmethod to search in practically any type of array that is sorted .\\nAn appropriate import  statement should be included in the source code to access\\nthe java.util.Arrays  class. In the code that follows, the return value –3 indicates\\nthat the key would have been found at index 2 had it been in the list:\\n// Sorted String array (natural ordering): [Bigfoot, big, bigger, biggest]\\n// Search in natural ordering:\\nint index1 = Arrays.binarySearch(strArray, \"bigger\");   // Successful:    2\\nint index2 = Arrays.binarySearch(strArray, \"bigfeet\");  // Unsuccessful: -3\\nint index3 = Arrays.binarySearch(strArray, \"bigmouth\"); // Unsuccessful: -5\\nResults are unpredictable if the array is not sorted, or if the ordering used in the\\nsearch is not the same as the sort ordering. Searching in the strArray  using natural\\nordering when the array is sorted in reverse natural ordering gives the wrong result:\\n// Sorted String array (inverse natural ordering): [biggest, bigger, big, Bigfoot]\\n// Search in natural ordering:\\nint index4 = Arrays.binarySearch(strArray, \"big\");  //  -1 (INCORRECT)\\nA ClassCastException  is thrown if the key and the elements are not mutually\\ncomparable:\\nint index5 = Arrays.binarySearch(strArray, 4); // Key: 4 => ClassCastException\\nHowever, this incompatibility is caught at  compile time in the case of arrays with\\nprimitive values:\\n// Sorted int array (natural ordering): [1, 3, 5, 7]\\nint index6 = Arrays.binarySearch(intArray, 4.5);//Key: 4.5 => compile-time error!\\nThe method binarySearch()  derives its name from the divide-and-conquer algorithm\\nthat it uses to perform the search. It repeatedly divides the remaining elements to be\\nsearched into two halves and selects the half containing the key to continue the\\nsearch in, until either the key is found or there are no more elements left to search. int binarySearch( type[] array, type key)\\nPermitted type for elements include byte, char, double , float , int, long, short ,\\nand Object . The array must be sorted in ascending order before calling this\\nmethod, or the results are unpredictable. In the case where an array of objects\\nis passed as argument, the objects  must be sorted in ascending order according\\nto their natural ordering , as defined by the Comparable  interface.\\nThe method returns the index to the key in  the sorted array, if the key exists.\\nThe index is then guaranteed to be greater or equal to 0. If the key is not found,\\na negative index is returned, corresponding to –( insertion point + 1 ), where\\ninsertion point  is the index of the element where the key would have been\\nfound, if it had been in the array. If there are duplicate elements equal to the\\nkey, there is no guarantee which duplicate’s index will be returned.

A method call  is used to\\ninvoke a method on an object. Parameters in the method call provide one way of\\nexchanging information between the caller object and the callee object (which need\\nnot be different). \\nDeclaring methods is discussed in §3.2, p.  49. Invoking static methods on classes is\\ndiscussed in §4.8, p. 132.\\nThe syntax of a method call can be any one of the following:\\nobject_reference .method_name (actual_parameter_list )\\nclass_name .static_method_name (actual_parameter_list )\\nmethod_name (actual_parameter_list )\\nThe object_reference  must be an expression that evaluates to a reference value denot-\\ning the object on which the method is called. If the caller and the callee are the\\nsame, object reference  can be omitted (see the discussion of the this reference in §3.2,\\np. 50). The class_name  can be the fully qualified name  (§4.2, p. 97) of the class. The\\nactual_parameter_list  is comma separated  if there is more than one parameter. The\\nparentheses are mandatory even if the actual parameter list is empty. This distin-\\nguishes the method call from field access.  One can specify fully qualified names for\\nclasses and packages using the dot operator ( .).\\nobjRef.doIt(time, place);         // Explicit object reference\\nint i = java.lang.Math.abs(-1);   // Fully qualified class name\\nint j = Math.abs(-1);             // Simple class name\\nsomeMethod(ofValue);              // Object or class implicitly implied\\nsomeObjRef.make().make().make();  // make() returns a reference value\\nThe dot operator ( .) has left associativity. In the last code line, the first call of the\\nmake()  method returns a reference value that denotes the object on which to execute\\nthe next call, and so on. This is an example of call chaining .\\nEach actual parameter  (also called an argument ) is an expression that is evaluated,\\nand whose value is passed to the method when the method is invoked. Its value\\ncan vary from invocation to invocation.  Formal parameters  are parameters defined\\nin the method declaration  (§3.2, p. 49) and are local to the method (§2.4, p. 44).\\nIn Java, all parameters are passed by value —that is, an actual parameter is evaluated\\nand its value is assigned to the correspo nding formal parameter. Table 3.1 summa-\\nrizes the value that is passed depending on  the type of the parameters. In the case\\nof primitive data types, the data value of the actual parameter is passed. If the\\nactual parameter is a reference to an object, the reference value of the denoted\\nobject is passed and not the object itself. Analogously, if the actual parameter is an\\narray element of a primitive data type, its data value is passed, and if the array ele-\\nment is a reference to an object, then its reference value is passed.3.5: PARAMETER PASSING 73\\nIt should also be stressed that each invocation of a method has its own copies of the\\nformal parameters, as is the case for any local variables in the method (§6.5, p. 230).\\nThe order of evaluation in the actual parameter list is always from left to right . The\\nevaluation of an actual parameter can be influenced by an earlier evaluation of an\\nactual parameter. Given the following declaration:\\nint i = 4;\\nthe method call\\nleftRight(i++, i);\\nis effectively the same as\\nleftRight(4, 5);\\nand not the same as\\nleftRight(4, 4);\\nAn overview of the conversions that can take place in a method invocation context\\nis provided in §5.2, p. 148. Method invo cation conversions for primitive values are\\ndiscussed in the next subsection (p. 73), and those for reference types are discussed\\nin §7.10, p. 315. Calling variable arit y methods is discussed in §3.6, p. 81.\\nFor the sake of simplicity, the examples in subsequent sections primarily show\\nmethod invocation on the same object or the same class. The parameter passing\\nmechanism is no different when different objects or classes are involved.\\nPassing Primitive Data Values\\nAn actual parameter is an expression that is evaluated first, with the resulting\\nvalue then being assigned to the corresponding formal parameter at method invo-\\ncation. The use of this value in the method has no influence on the actual parame-\\nter. In particular, when the actual paramete r is a variable of a primitive data type,\\nthe value of the variable is copied to th e formal parameter at method invocation.\\nSince formal parameters are local to the method, any changes made to the formal\\nparameter will not be reflected in the actual parameter after the call completes.\\nLegal type conversions between actual parameters and formal parameters of prim-\\nitive data types  are summarized here from Table 5.1, p. 147:\\n• Widening primitive conversion\\n• Unboxing conversion, followed by an optional widening primitive conversionTable 3.1 Parameter Passing by Value\\nData type of the formal parameter Value passed\\nPrimitive data type Primitive data value of the actual parameter\\nReference type (i.e., class, interface, \\narray, or enum type)Reference value of the actual parameter74 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\nThese conversions are illustrated by invoking the following method\\nstatic void doIt(long i) { /* ... */ }\\nwith the following code:\\nInteger intRef = 34;\\nLong longRef = 34L;\\ndoIt(34);         // (1) Primitive widening conversion: long <-- int\\ndoIt(longRef);    // (2) Unboxing: long <-- Long\\ndoIt(intRef);     // (3) Unboxing, followed by primitive widening conversion:\\n                  //     long <-- int <-- Integer\\nHowever, for parameter passing, there are no implicit narrowing conversions for\\ninteger constant expressions (§5.2, p. 148).\\nExample 3.6 Passing Primitive Values\\npublic class CustomerOne {\\n  public static void main (String[] args) {\\n    PizzaFactory pizzaHouse = new PizzaFactory();\\n    int pricePrPizza = 15;\\n    System.out.println(\"Value of pricePrPizza before call: \" + pricePrPizza);\\n    double totPrice = pizzaHouse.calcPrice(4, pricePrPizza);             // (1)\\n    System.out.println(\"Value of pricePrPizza after call: \" + pricePrPizza);\\n  }\\n}\\nclass PizzaFactory {\\n  public double calcPrice(int numberOfPizzas, double pizzaPrice) {       // (2)\\n    pizzaPrice = pizzaPrice / 2.0;       // Changes price.\\n    System.out.println(\"Changed pizza price in the method: \" + pizzaPrice);\\n    return numberOfPizzas * pizzaPrice;\\n  }\\n}\\nOutput from the program:\\nValue of pricePrPizza before call: 15\\nChanged pizza price in the method: 7.5\\nValue of pricePrPizza after call: 15\\nIn Example 3.6, the method calcPrice()  is defined in the class PizzaFactory  at (2). It\\nis called from the CustomerOne.main()  method at (1). The value of the first actual\\nparameter, 4, is copied to the int formal parameter numberOfPizzas . Note that the\\nsecond actual parameter pricePrPizza  is of the type int, while the corresponding\\nformal parameter pizzaPrice  is of the type double . Before the value of the actual\\nparameter pricePrPizza  is copied to the formal parameter pizzaPrice , it is implicitly\\nwidened to a double . The passing of primitive values is illustrated in Figure 3.2.\\nThe value of the formal parameter pizzaPrice  is changed in the calcPrice()\\nmethod,  but this does not affect the value of the actual parameter pricePrPizza  on3.5: PARAMETER PASSING 75\\nreturn: It still has the value 15. The bottom line is that the formal parameter is a\\nlocal variable, and changing its value does no t affect the value of the actual parameter.\\nPassing Reference Values\\nIf the actual parameter expression evaluates to a reference value, the resulting ref-\\nerence value is assigned to the corresponding formal parameter reference at\\nmethod invocation. In particular, if an actual parameter is a reference to an object,\\nthe reference value stored in the actual pa rameter is passed. Consequently, both the\\nactual parameter and the formal parameter are aliases to the object denoted by this\\nreference value during the invocation of the method. In particular, this implies that\\nchanges made to the object via the formal parameter will be apparent after the call\\nreturns.\\nType conversions between actual and formal parameters of reference types are\\ndiscussed in §7.10, p. 315.\\nIn Example 3.7, a Pizza  object is created at (1). Any object of the class Pizza  created\\nusing the class declaration at (5) always results in a beef pizza. In the call to the\\nbake()  method at (2), the reference value of the object referenced by the actual\\nparameter favoritePizza  is assigned to the formal parameter pizzaToBeBaked  in the\\ndeclaration of the bake()  method at (3).\\nExample 3.7 Passing Reference Values\\npublic class CustomerTwo {\\n  public static void main (String[] args) {\\n    Pizza favoritePizza = new Pizza();              // (1)\\n    System.out.println(\"Meat on pizza before baking: \" + favoritePizza.meat);\\n    bake(favoritePizza);                            // (2)\\n    System.out.println(\"Meat on pizza after baking: \" + favoritePizza.meat);\\n  }Figure 3.2 Parameter Passing: Primitive Data Values\\n15.OD\\n15.OD15\\n44\\n, double pizzaPrice, pricePrPizza  );\\n ) {double totPrice = pizzaHouse.calcPrice(\\npublic double calcPrice(int numberOfPizzas\\n        pizzaPrice = pizzaPrice / 2.0;\\n        return numberOfPizzas * pizzaPrice;\\n}Formal ParametersMethod Call\\nMethod DefinitionActual Parameters\\nPrimitive widening conversion76 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\n  public static void bake(Pizza pizzaToBeBaked) {   // (3)\\n    pizzaToBeBaked.meat = \"chicken\";  // Change the meat on the pizza.\\n    pizzaToBeBaked = null;                          // (4)\\n  }\\n}\\nclass Pizza {                                       // (5)\\n  String meat = \"beef\";\\n}\\nOutput from the program:\\nMeat on pizza before baking: beef\\nMeat on pizza after baking: chicken\\nOne particular consequence of passing reference values to formal parameters is\\nthat any changes made to the object via formal parameters will be reflected back in\\nthe calling method when the call returns. In this case, the reference favoritePizza\\nwill show that chicken has been substituted for beef on the pizza. Setting the for-\\nmal parameter pizzaToBeBaked  to null at (4) does not change the reference value in\\nthe actual parameter favoritePizza . The situation at method invocation, and just\\nbefore the return from method bake() , is illustrated in Figure 3.3.\\nFigure 3.3 Parameter Passing: Reference Values\\nfavoritePizza:Ref(Pizza) Actual Parameter\\npizzaToBeBaked:Ref(Pizza) \\nFormal Parametermeat = \"beef\" :Pizza Copying of reference\\nvalue creates aliases.\\nActual Parameter\\npizzaToBeBaked:Ref(Pizza) \\nFormal Parametermeat = \"chicken\" :Pizza After return, the actual parameter still denotes\\nthe same object whose state has changed.(a) At method call\\n(b) Just before returnfavoritePizza:Ref(Pizza)3.5: PARAMETER PASSING 77\\nIn summary, the formal parameter can only change the state  of the object whose\\nreference value was passed to the method.\\nThe parameter passing strategy in Java is call by value  and not call by reference ,\\nregardless of the type of the parameter. Call by reference would have allowed\\nvalues in the actual parameters to be ch anged via formal parameters; that is, the\\nvalue in pricePrPizza  would be halved in Example 3.6 and favoritePizza  would be\\nset to null in Example 3.7. However, this cann ot be directly implemented in Java.\\nPassing Arrays\\nThe discussion of passing reference values in the previous section is equally valid\\nfor arrays, as arrays are objects in Java . Method invocation conversions for array\\ntypes are discussed along with those for other reference types in §7.10, p. 315.\\nIn Example 3.8, the idea is to repeatedly swap neighboring elements in an integer\\narray until the largest element in the array percolates  to the last position in the array.\\nExample 3.8 Passing Arrays\\npublic class Percolate {\\n  public static void main (String[] args) {\\n    int[] dataSeq = {8,4,6,2,1};    // Create and initialize an array.\\n    // Write array before percolation:\\n    printIntArray(dataSeq);\\n    // Percolate:\\n    for (int index = 1; index < dataSeq.length; ++index)\\n      if (dataSeq[index-1] > dataSeq[index])\\n        swap(dataSeq, index-1, index);                    // (1)\\n    // Write array after percolation:\\n    printIntArray(dataSeq);\\n  }\\n  public static void swap(int[] intArray, int i, int j) { // (2)\\n    int tmp = intArray[i]; intArray[i] = intArray[j]; intArray[j] = tmp;\\n  }\\n  public static void swap(int v1, int v2) {               // (3) Logical error!\\n    int tmp = v1; v1 = v2; v2 = tmp;\\n  }\\n  public static void printIntArray(int[] array) {         // (4)\\n    for (int value : array)\\n      System.out.print(\" \" + value);\\n    System.out.println();\\n  }\\n}78 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\nOutput from the program:\\n8 4 6 2 1\\n4 6 2 1 8\\nNote that in the declaration of the method swap()  at (2), the formal parameter\\nintArray  is of the array type int[] . The swap()  method is called in the main()  method\\nat (1), where one of the actual parameters is the array variable dataSeq . The refer-\\nence value of the array variable dataSeq  is assigned to the array variable intArray  at\\nmethod invocation. After return from the call to the swap()  method, the array vari-\\nable dataSeq  will reflect the changes made to the array via the corresponding formal\\nparameter. This situation is depicted in Figure 3.4 at the first call and return from\\nthe swap()  method, indicating how the values of the elements at indices 0 and 1 in\\nthe array have been swapped.\\nHowever, the declaration of the swap()  method at (3) will not swap two values. The\\nmethod call\\nswap(dataSeq[index-1], dataSeq[index]);\\nwill have no effect on the array elements, as the swapping is done on the values of\\nthe formal parameters.\\nThe method printIntArray()  at (4) also has a formal parameter of array type int[] .\\nNote that the formal parameter is specified as an array reference using the [] nota-\\ntion, but this notation is not used when an array is passed as an actual parameter. \\nArray Elements as Actual Parameters\\nArray elements, like other variables, can stor e values of primitive data types or ref-\\nerence values of objects. In the latter ca se, they can also be arrays—that is, arrays\\nof arrays (§3.4, p. 63). If an array element is of a primitive data type, its data value\\nis passed; if it is a reference to an object, the reference value is passed. The method\\ninvocation conversions apply to the values of array elements as well.Figure 3.4 Parameter Passing: Arrays\\nActual Parameter\\nFormal Parameter:int[] \\n[0] 8 \\n[1] 4 \\n[2] 6 \\n[3] 2 \\n[4] 1 \\n(a) At first call to the swap()  methodActual Parameter\\nFormal Parameter[0] 4 \\n[1] 8 \\n[2] 6 \\n[3] 2 \\n[4] 1 \\n(b) Just before first return from the swap()  methoddataSeq:Ref(int[]) dataSeq:Ref(int[]) :int[] \\n intArray:Ref(int[]) intArray:Ref(int[])3.5: PARAMETER PASSING 79\\nExample 3.9 Array Elements as Primitive Data Values\\npublic class FindMinimum {\\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\\n    int[] dataSeq = {6,4,8,2,1};\\n    int minValue = dataSeq[0];\\n    for (int index = 1; index < dataSeq.length; ++index)\\n      minValue = minimum(minValue, dataSeq[index]);            // (1)\\n    System.out.println(\"Minimum value: \" + minValue);\\n  }\\n  public static int minimum(int i, int j) {                    // (2)\\n    return (i <= j) ? i : j;\\n  }\\n}\\nOutput from the program:\\nMinimum value: 1\\nIn Example 3.9, the value of all but one element of the array dataSeq  is retrieved and\\npassed consecutively at (1) to the formal parameter j of the minimum()  method\\ndefined at (2). The discussion in §3.5, p. 73, on passing primitive values also applies\\nto array elements that have primitive values.\\nIn Example 3.10, the formal parameter seq of the findMinimum()  method defined at (4)\\nis an array variable. The variable matrix  denotes an array of arrays declared at (1)\\nsimulating a multidimensional array, which has three rows, where each row is a\\nsimple array. The first row, denoted by matrix[0] , is passed to the findMinimum()\\nmethod in the call at (2). Each remaining row is passed by its reference value in the\\ncall to the findMinimum()  method at (3).\\nExample 3.10 Array Elements as Reference Values\\npublic class FindMinimumMxN {\\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\\n    int[][] matrix = { {8,4},{6,3,2},{7} };                  // (1)\\n    int min = findMinimum(matrix[0]);                        // (2)\\n    for (int i = 1; i < matrix.length; ++i) {\\n      int minInRow = findMinimum(matrix[i]);                 // (3)\\n      min = Math.min(min, minInRow);\\n    }\\n    System.out.println(\"Minimum value in matrix: \" + min);\\n  }80 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\n  public static int findMinimum(int[] seq) {                 // (4)\\n    int min = seq[0];\\n    for (int i = 1; i < seq.length; ++i)\\n      min = Math.min(min, seq[i]);\\n    return min;\\n  }\\n}\\nOutput from the program:\\nMinimum value in matrix: 2\\nfinal  Parameters\\nA formal parameter can be declared with the keyword final  preceding the para-\\nmeter declaration in the method declaration. A final  parameter is also known as a\\nblank final variable ; that is, it is blank (uninitialized) until a value is assigned to it,\\n(e.g., at method invocation) and then the value in the variable cannot be changed\\nduring the lifetime of the variable (see also  the discussion in §4.8, p. 133). The com-\\npiler can treat final  variables as constants for code optimization purposes. Declar-\\ning parameters as final  prevents their values from being changed inadvertently. A\\nformal parameter\\'s declaration as final  does not affect the caller’s code. \\nThe declaration of the method calcPrice()  from Example 3.6 is shown next, with\\nthe formal parameter pizzaPrice  declared as final :\\npublic double calcPrice(int numberOfPizzas, final double pizzaPrice) {  // (2’)\\n  pizzaPrice = pizzaPrice/2.0;                       // (3) Not allowed\\n  return numberOfPizzas * pizzaPrice;\\n}\\nIf this declaration of the calcPrice()  method is compiled, the compiler will not\\nallow the value of the final  parameter pizzaPrice  to be changed at (3) in the body\\nof the method.\\nAs another example, the declaration of the method bake()  from Example 3.7 is\\nshown here, with the formal parameter pizzaToBeBaked  declared as final :\\npublic static void bake(final Pizza pizzaToBeBaked) { // (3)\\n  pizzaToBeBaked.meat = \"chicken\";                    // (3a) Allowed\\n  pizzaToBeBaked = null;                              // (4) Not allowed\\n}\\nIf this declaration of the bake()  method is compiled, the compiler will not allow the\\nreference value of the final  parameter pizzaToBeBaked  to be changed at (4) in the\\nbody of the method. Note that this applies to the reference value in the final  para-\\nmeter, but not to the object denoted by this parameter. The state of the object can\\nbe changed as before, as shown at (3a).3.6: VARIABLE ARITY METHODS 81\\n3.6 Variable Arity Methods\\nA fixed arity  method must be called with the same number of actual parameters\\n(also called arguments ) as the number of formal parameters specified in its declara-\\ntion. If the method declaration specifies two formal parameters, every call of this\\nmethod must specify exactly two arguments.  We say that the arity of this method\\nis 2. In other words, the arity of such a method is fixed, and it is equal to the num-\\nber of formal parameters specified in the method declaration.\\nJava also allows declaration of variable arity  methods, meaning that the number of\\narguments in its call can be varied . As we shall see, invocations of such a method\\nmay contain more actual parameters than formal parameters. Variable arity meth-\\nods are heavily employed in formatting text representation of values, as demon-\\nstrated by the variable arity method  System.out.printf()  that is used in many\\nexamples for this purpose.\\nThe last formal parameter in a variable arity me thod declaration is declared as follows:\\ntype... formal_parameter_name\\nThe ellipsis ( ...) is specified between the type and the formal_parameter_name . The\\ntype can be a primitive type, a reference type , or a type parameter. Whitespace can\\nbe specified on both sides of the ellipsi s. Such a parameter is usually called a vari-\\nable arity parameter (also known as varargs ).\\nApart from the variable arity parameter, a variable arity method is identical to a\\nfixed arity method. The method publish()  is a variable arity method:\\npublic static void publish(int n, String... data) {      // (int, String[])\\n  System.out.println(\"n: \" + n + \", data size: \" + data.length);\\n}\\nThe variable arity parameter in a variable  arity method is al ways interpreted as\\nhaving an array type:\\ntype[]\\nIn the body of the publish()  method, the variable arity parameter data has the type\\nString[] , so it is a simple array of String s. \\nOnly one variable arity parameter is permitted in the formal parameter list, and it\\nis always the last parameter in the formal parameter list. Given that the method\\ndeclaration has n formal parameters, and the method call has k actual parameters,\\nk must be equal to or greater than n – 1. The last k – n + 1 actual parameters are eval-\\nuated and stored in an array whose refere nce value is passed as the value of the\\nactual parameter. In the case of the publish()  method, n is equal to 2, so k can be 1,\\n2, 3, and so on. The following invocations of the publish()  method show which\\narguments are passed in each method call:\\npublish(1);                  // (1, new String[] {})\\npublish(2, \"two\");           // (2, new String[] {\"two\"})\\npublish(3, \"two\", \"three\");  // (3, new String[] {\"two\", \"three\"})82 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\nEach method call results in an implicit array being created and passed as an argu-\\nment. This array can contain zero or more argument values that do not correspond\\nto the formal parameters preceding the vari able arity parameter. This array is ref-\\nerenced by the variable arity parameter data in the method declaration. The pre-\\nceding calls would result in the publish()  method printing the following output:\\nn: 1, data size: 0\\nn: 2, data size: 1\\nn: 3, data size: 2\\nTo overload a variable arity method, it is not enough to change the type of the vari-\\nable arity parameter to an explicit arra y type. The compiler will complain if an\\nattempt is made to overload the method transmit() , as shown in the following\\ncode:\\npublic static void transmit(String... data) {  }  // Compile-time error!\\npublic static void transmit(String[] data)  {  }  // Compile-time error!\\nThese declarations would result in two methods with equivalent signatures in the\\nsame class, which is not permitted. \\nOverloading and overriding of methods with variable arity are discussed in §7.10,\\np. 316.\\nCalling a Variable Arity Method\\nExample 3.11 illustrates various aspects of calling a variable arity method. The\\nmethod flexiPrint()  in the VarargsDemo  class has a variable arity parameter:\\npublic static void flexiPrint(Object... data) { // Object[]\\n  //...\\n}\\nThe variable arity method prints the name of the Class  object representing the\\nactual array  that is passed at runtime. It prints the number of elements in this array\\nas well as the text representation of each element in the array. \\nThe method flexiPrint()  is called in the main()  method.

The refer-\\nence value of this array is passed to the method. The printout shows that the type\\nof the parameter is actually an array of Object s ([Ljava.lang.Object; ). \\nThe call at (6) differs from the previous calls, in that the actual parameter is an array\\nthat has the same  type (Object[] ) as the variable arity parameter, without having to\\ncreate an implicit array. In such a case, no implicit array is created, and the reference\\nvalue of the array dateInfo  is passed to the method. See also the result from this call\\nat (6) in the output. The call at (6) is a fixed arity call  (also called a non-varargs call ),\\nwhere no implicit array is created: \\nflexiPrint(dateInfo);              // (6) Non-varargs call\\nHowever, if the actual parameter is cast to the type Object  as in (7), a variable arity\\ncall is executed:\\nflexiPrint((Object) dateInfo);     // (7) new Object[] {(Object) dateInfo}\\nThe type of the actual argument is now not the same as that of the variable arity\\nparameter, resulting in an array of the type Object[]  being created, in which the\\narray dateInfo  is stored as an element. The printout at (7) shows that only the text\\nrepresentation of the dateInfo  array is printed, and not its elements, as it is the sole\\nelement of the implicit array.3.7: THE MAIN()  METHOD 85\\nThe call at (8) is a fixed arity  call, for the same reason as the call in (6). Now, how-\\never, the array dateInfo  is explicitly stored as an element in an array of the type\\nObject[]  that matches the type of the variable arity parameter: \\nflexiPrint(new Object[]{dateInfo});// (8) Non-varargs call\\nThe output from (8) is the same as the output from (7), where the array dateInfo\\nwas passed as an element in an implicitly created array of type Object[] .\\nThe compiler issues a warning  for the call at (9): \\nflexiPrint(args);                  // (9) Warning!\\nThe actual parameter args is an array of the type String[] , which is a subtype  of\\nObject[] —the type of the variable arity parameter. The array args can be passed in\\na fixed arity call as an array of the type String[] , or in a variable arity call as an ele-\\nment  in an implicitly created array of the type Object[] . Both  calls are feasible and\\nvalid in this case. Note that the compiler chooses a fixed arity call rather than a\\nvariable arity call, but also issues a warning. The result at (9) confirms this course\\nof action.\\nThe array args of the type String[]  is explicitly passed as an Object  in a variable\\narity call at (10), similar to the call at (7):\\nflexiPrint((Object) args);         // (10) Explicit varargs call\\nThe array args of type String[]  is explicitly passed as an array of the type Object[]  in\\na fixed arity call at (11). This call is equiva lent to the call at (9), where the widening\\nreference conversion is implicit, but now without a warning at compile time. The\\ntwo calls print the same information, as is evident from the output at (9) and (11):\\nflexiPrint((Object[]) args);       // (11) Explicit non-varargs call\\n3.7 The main()  Method\\nThe mechanics of compiling and running Java applications using the JDK are out-\\nlined in §1.10, p. 16. The java command executes a method called main in the class\\nspecified on the command line. Any class can have a main()  method, but only the\\nmain()  method of the class specified in the java command starts the execution of a\\nJava application.\\nThe main()  method must have public  accessibility so that the JVM can call this\\nmethod (§4.7, p. 123). It is a static  method belonging to the class, so that no object\\nof the class is required to start the execution (§4.8, p. 132). It does not return a value;\\nthat is, it is declared as void (§6.4, p. 224). It always has an array of String  objects\\nas its only formal parameter. This array contains any arguments passed to the pro-\\ngram on the command line (see the next subsection). The following method header\\ndeclarations fit the bill, and any one of them can be used for the main()  method:\\npublic static void main(String[] args)    // Method header\\npublic static void main(String... args)   // Method header86 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\nThe three modifiers can occur in any order in the method header. The requirements\\ngiven in these examples do not exclude sp ecification of additional modifiers (§4.8,\\np. 131) or any throws  clause (§6.9, p. 251). The main()  method can also be overloaded\\nlike any other method (§3.2, p. 52). The JVM ensures that the main()  method having\\nthe previously mentioned method header is the starting point of program execution.\\nProgram Arguments\\nAny arguments passed to the program on the command line can be accessed in the\\nmain()  method of the class specified on the command line:\\n>java Colors red green blue\\nThese arguments are called program arguments . Note that the command name, java,\\nand the class name Colors  are not passed to the main() method of the class Colors , nor\\nare any other options that are specified on the command line passed to this method.\\nSince the formal parameter of the main()  method is an array of String  objects, indi-\\nvidual String  elements in the array can be accessed by using the [] operator.\\nIn Example 3.12, the three arguments red, green , and blue can be accessed in the\\nmain()  method of the Colors  class as args[0] , args[1] , and args[2] , respectively. The\\ntotal number of arguments is given by the field length  of the String  array args. Note\\nthat program arguments can be passed only as strings, and must be explicitly con-\\nverted to other values by the program, if necessary.\\nWhen no arguments are specified on the command line, an array of zero String  ele-\\nments is created and passed to the main()  method. Thus the reference value of the\\nformal parameter in the main()  method is never null.\\nProgram arguments supply information to the application, which can be used to\\ntailor the runtime behavior of the applic ation according to user requirements.\\nExample 3.12 Passing Program Arguments\\npublic class Colors {\\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\\n    System.out.println(\"No. of program arguments: \" + args.length);\\n    for (int i = 0; i < args.length; i++)\\n      System.out.println(\"Argument no. \" + i + \" (\" + args[i] + \") has \" +\\n                          args[i].length() + \" characters.\");\\n  }\\n}\\nRunning the program:\\n>java Colors red green blue\\nNo. of program arguments: 3\\nArgument no. 0 (red) has 3 characters.\\nArgument no. 1 (green) has 5 characters.\\nArgument no. 2 (blue) has 4 characters.3.8: ENUMERATED TYPES 87\\n3.8 Enumerated Types\\nIn this section we provide a basic in troduction to enumerated types. An enumerated\\ntype defines a finite set of symbolic names and their values . These symbolic names are\\nusually called enum constants  or named constants . \\nOne way to define constants is to declare them as final , static  variables in a class\\n(or interface) declaration:\\npublic class MachineState {\\n  public static final int BUSY = 1;\\n  public static final int IDLE = 0;\\n  public static final int BLOCKED = -1;\\n}\\nSuch constants are not type-safe, as any int value can be used where we need to use\\na constant declared in the MachineState  class. Such a constant must be qualified by\\nthe class (or interface) name, unless the cl ass is extended (or the interface is imple-\\nmented). When such a constant is printed, only its value (for example, 0), and not\\nits name (for example, IDLE), is printed. A constant also needs recompiling if its\\nvalue is changed, as the values of such constants are compiled into the client code.\\nAn enumerated type in Java is a special kind of class type that is much more pow-\\nerful than the approach outlined earlier for defining collections of named constants.\\nDeclaring Type-safe Enums\\nThe canonical form of declaring an enum  type is shown here:\\npublic enum MachineState        // Enum header\\n{                               // Enum body\\n  BUSY, IDLE, BLOCKED           // Enum constants\\n}\\nThe keyword enum is used to declare an enum type, as opposed to the keyword\\nclass  for a class declaration. The basic notation requires the enum type name  in\\nenum header, and a comma-separated list of enum constants  can be specified in the\\nenum body. Optionally, an access modifier can also be specified in the enum\\nheader, as for a (top-level) class. In the example enum declaration, the name of the\\nenum type is MachineState . It defines three enum constants with explicit names. An\\nenum constant can be any legal Java identi fier, but the convention is to use upper-\\ncase letters in the name. Essentially, an enum declaration defines a reference type\\nthat has a finite number of permissible values  referenced by the enum constants, and\\nthe compiler ensures they are used in a type-safe manner. \\nOther member declarations can be specified in the body of an enum type, but the\\ncanonical form suffices for the purpose of this book. Analogous to a class declara-\\ntion, an enum type is compiled to Java byte code that is placed in a separate class\\nfile.88 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\nThe enum types java.time.Month  and java.time.DayOfWeek  are two examples of\\nenum types from the Java SE platform API. As we would expect, the Month  enum\\ntype represents the months from JANUARY  to DECEMBER , and the DayOfWeek  enum type\\nrepresents the days of the week from MONDAY  to SUNDAY . Examples of their usage can\\nbe found in §11.2, p. 462.\\nSome additional examples of enum types follow:\\npublic enum MarchingOrders { LEFT, RIGHT }\\npublic enum TrafficLightState { RED, YELLOW, GREEN }\\nenum MealType { BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER }\\nUsing Type-safe Enums\\nExample 3.13 illustrates the use of enum constants. An enum type is essentially\\nused in the same way as any other reference type. Enum constants are actually\\npublic , static , final  fields of the enum type, and they are implicitly initialized with\\ninstances of the enum type when the enum type is loaded at runtime. Since the\\nenum constants are static members, they can be accessed using the name of the\\nenum type—analogous to accessing static members in a class or an interface.\\nExample 3.13 shows a machine client that uses a machine whose state is an enum\\nconstant. In this example, we see that an enum constant can be passed as an argu-\\nment, as shown as (1), and we can declare references whose type is an enum type,\\nas shown as (3), but we cannot  create new constants (that is, objects) of the enum\\ntype MachineState . An attempt to do so, at (5), results in a compile-time error.\\nThe string representation of an enum constant is its name, as shown at (4). Note\\nthat it is not possible to pass a type of value other than a MachineState  enum con-\\nstant in the call to the method setState()  of the Machine  class, as shown at (2).\\nExample 3.13 Using Enums\\n// File: MachineState.java\\npublic enum MachineState { BUSY, IDLE, BLOCKED }\\n// File: Machine.java\\npublic class Machine {\\n  private MachineState state;\\n  public void setState(MachineState state) { this.state = state; }\\n  public MachineState getState() { return this.state; }\\n}\\n// File: MachineClient.java\\npublic class MachineClient {\\n  public static void main(String[] args) {3.8: ENUMERATED TYPES 89\\n    Machine machine = new Machine();\\n    machine.setState(MachineState.IDLE);            // (1) Passed as a value.\\n    // machine.setState(1);                         // (2) Compile-time error!\\n    MachineState state = machine.getState();        // (3) Declaring a reference.\\n    System.out.println(\\n        \"Current machine state: \" + state           // (4) Printing the enum name.\\n    );\\n    // MachineState newState = new MachineState();  // (5) Compile-time error!\\n    System.out.println(\"All machine states:\");\\n    for (MachineState ms : MachineState.values()) { // (6) Traversing over enum\\n      System.out.println(ms + \":\" + ms.ordinal());  //     contants.\\n    }\\n    System.out.println(\"Comparison:\");\\n    MachineState state1 = MachineState.BUSY;\\n    MachineState state2 = state1;\\n    MachineState state3 = MachineState.BLOCKED;\\n    System.out.println(state1 + \" == \" + state2 + \": \" +\\n                       (state1 == state2));                           // (7)\\n    System.out.println(state1 + \" is equal to \" + state2 + \": \" +\\n                       (state1.equals(state2)));                      // (8)\\n    System.out.println(state1 + \" is less than \" + state3 + \": \" +\\n                       (state1.compareTo(state3) < 0));               // (9)\\n  }\\n}\\nOutput from the program:\\nCurrent machine state: IDLE\\nAll machine states:\\nBUSY:0\\nIDLE:1\\nBLOCKED:2\\nComparison:\\nBUSY == BUSY: true\\nBUSY is equal to BUSY: true\\nBUSY is less than BLOCKED: true\\nSelected Methods for Enum Types\\nAll enum types implicitly have the following useful method:\\nThe loop at (6) in Example 3.13 illustrates traversing over all the MachineState  enum\\nconstants in the order they are specified. An array containing all the MachineState\\nconstants is obtained by calling the static method values()  on the enum type.static EnumTypeName [] values()\\nReturns an array containing the enum constants of this enum type, in the order\\nthey are specified .90 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\nAll enum types are subtypes of the java.lang.Enum  class, which provides the default\\nbehavior. All enum types inherit the following selected methods from the\\njava.lang.Enum  class:\\nNote that the equality test implemented by the equals()  method is based on refer-\\nence equality ( ==) of the enum constants, not on value equality. An enum type has\\na finite number of distinct objects. Comparing two enum references for equality\\nmeans determining whether they store the reference value of the same enum con-\\nstant—in other words, whether the references are aliases. Thus, for any two enum\\nreferences state1  and state2 , the expressions state1.equals(state2)  and state1 ==\\nstate2  are equivalent, as shown at (7) and (8) in Example 3.13. \\nThe ordinal value of the constants in an enum type determines the result of compar-\\ning such constants with the compareTo()  method, as shown at (9) in Example 3.13.\\nReview Questions\\n3.13 What will the following program print when run?\\npublic class ParameterPass {\\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\\n    int i = 0;\\n    addTwo(i++);\\n    System.out.println(i);\\n  }\\n  static void addTwo(int i) {\\n    i += 2;\\n  }\\n}final boolean equals(Object other)\\nThis method returns true if the specified object is equal to this enum constant. \\nfinal int compareTo(E other)\\nThe natural order  of the enum constants in an enum type is based on their ordinal\\nvalues  (see the ordinal()  method next). The compareTo()  method of the Comparable\\ninterface returns the value zero if this enum constant is equal to the other enum\\nconstant, a value less than zero if this enum constant is less than the other\\nenum constant, or a value greater than zero if this enum constant is greater\\nthan the other enum constant.\\nfinal int ordinal()\\nThis method returns the ordinal value  of this enum constant (that is, its position\\nin its enum type declaration). The first enum constant is assigned an ordinal\\nvalue of zero. If the ordinal value of an enum constant is less than the ordinal\\nvalue of another enum constant of the same enum type, the former occurs\\nbefore the latter in the enum type declaration.3.8: ENUMERATED TYPES 91\\nSelect the one correct answer.\\n(a) 0\\n(b) 1\\n(c) 2\\n(d) 3\\n3.14 What will be the result of compiling and running the following program?\\npublic class Passing {\\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\\n    int a = 0; int b = 0;\\n    int[] bArr = new int[1]; bArr[0] = b;\\n    inc1(a); inc2(bArr);\\n    System.out.println(\"a=\" + a + \" b=\" + b + \" bArr[0]=\" + bArr[0]);\\n  }\\n  public static void inc1(int x) { x++; }\\n  public static void inc2(int[] x) { x[0]++; }\\n}\\nSelect the one correct answer.\\n(a) The code will fail to compile, since x[0]++;  is not a legal statement.\\n(b) The code will compile and will print a=1 b=1 bArr[0]=1  at runtime.\\n(c) The code will compile and will print a=0 b=1 bArr[0]=1  at runtime.\\n(d) The code will compile and will print a=0 b=0 bArr[0]=1  at runtime.\\n(e) The code will compile and will print a=0 b=0 bArr[0]=0  at runtime.\\n3.15 Which statements, when inserted at (1), will result in a compile-time error?\\npublic class ParameterUse {\\n  static void main(String[] args) {\\n    int a = 0;\\n    final int b = 1;\\n    int[] c = { 2 };\\n    final int[] d = { 3 };\\n    useArgs(a, b, c, d);\\n  }\\n  static void useArgs(final int a, int b, final int[] c, int[] d) {\\n    // (1) INSERT STATEMENT HERE.\\n  }\\n}\\nSelect the two correct answers.\\n(a)a++;\\n(b)b++;\\n(c)b = a;\\n(d)c[0]++;\\n(e)d[0]++;\\n(f)c = d;92 CHAPTER 3: DECLARATIONS\\n3.16 Which of the following method declarations are valid declarations?\\nSelect the three correct answers.\\n(a)void compute(int... is) { }\\n(b)void compute(int is...) { }\\n(c)void compute(int... is, int i, String... ss) { }\\n(d)void compute(String... ds) { }\\n(e)void compute(String... ss, int len) { }\\n(f)void compute(char[] ca, int... is) { }\\n3.17 Given the following code:\\npublic class RQ810A40 {\\n  static void print(Object... obj) {\\n    System.out.println(\"Object...: \" + obj[0]);\\n  }\\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\\n    // (1) INSERT METHOD CALL HERE.\\n  }\\n}\\nWhich method call, when inserted at (1), will not result in the following output\\nfrom the program:\\nObject...: 9\\nSelect the one correct answer.\\n(a)print(\"9\", \"1\", \"1\");\\n(b)print(9, 1, 1);\\n(c)print(new int[] {9, 1, 1});\\n(d)print(new Integer[] {9, 1, 1});\\n(e)print(new String[] {\"9\", \"1\", \"1\"});\\n(f)print(new Object[] {\"9\", \"1\", \"1\"});\\n(g) None of the above.\\nChapter Summary\\nThe following topics were covered in this chapter:\\n• An overview of declarations that can be specified in a class\\n• Declaration of methods, usage of the this reference in an instance method, and\\nmethod overloading\\n• Declaration of constructors, usage of the default constructor, and overloading\\nof constructors\\n• Explanation of declaration, construction, initialization, and usage of both one-\\ndimensional and multidimensional arrays, including anonymous arrays\\n• Sorting and searching arraysPROGRAMMING EXERCISE 93\\n• Parameter passing, both primitive values and object references, including\\narrays and array elements; and declaring final  parameters\\n• Declaring and calling methods with variable arity\\n• Declaration of the main()  method whose execution starts the application\\n• Passing program arguments to the main()  method\\n• Declaring and using simple enum types\\nProgramming Exercise\\n3.1 Write a program to grade a short multiple-choice quiz.

      "index 0 and the last element at index n – 1, where n is the value of the length  field\n",

      "value of an array of any length, as long as its elements have element_type.\n",
      "It is important to understand that the declaration does not actually create an array.\n",
      "Instead, it simply declares a reference  that can refer to an array object. The [] nota-\n",

      "Constructing an Array\n",

      "In the next examples, the code constructs the array, and the array elements are\n",
